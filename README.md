# mmidi-archive
Archive of Sono's mmidi files.

## What is mmidi?
Take a look at [here](https://blackmidi.fandom.com/wiki/Software:mmidi "here").

## What are those files?
Since [Sono's website](https://sono.9net.org/prog/mmidi/ "Sono's website") was down, nobody can download mmidi from there. So I got almost all the files and make an archive here.

## What are the differences?
Idk too. But you might want to look [here](https://blackmidi.fandom.com/wiki/Software:mmidi#Players "here"). I would recommand mmmmidi_mem.exe for audio playback or mmvis.exe for midi visual preview.

## Original website?
The original website was down. If you still want to visit, [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210303203008id_/https://sono.9net.org/prog/mmidi/ "here").
